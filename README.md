## Key Findings
### 1. Top paying data analyst jobs

To identify top-paying jobs, I filtered data analyst positions be average yearly salary and location, comparing remote & hybrid and on-site categories. Below query retrieves the top 10 data analyst related jobs for those remote & hybrid work types.
```sql
SELECT job_id,
       job_title, 
       job_title_short, 
       job_location, 
       job_posted_date :: DATE AS posted_date, 
       salary_year_avg, 
       company_dim.name AS company_name
FROM job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim
ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

![data description](visuals/query_1.2.png)
- **Wide salary range & gap**:
    - Top 10 data analyst jobs in both on-site and remote & hybrid job market show a broad salary range, spanning from $184,000 to $650,000 for on-site roles and $245,000 to $400,000 for remote & hybrid roles. This indicates significant earning potencial in the field.
    - Generally, on-site job positions offer higher average yearly salaries compared to remote & hybrid positions. A key factor behind this gap may be seniority levels - in both cases, half or more of the top roles carry titles like Seniors, Head, or Director. This pattern indicates a salary stratification within data analyst roles, where more senior, specialized, or managerial positions - particulary those on-site - are compensated at a premium level.
 
### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To undersand what skills are required for above top-paying jobs focusing on remote & hybrid type of work, I joined the job positings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for those high-compensation roles. 
```sql
with top_paying_jobs as (
    SELECT job_id,
        job_title, 
        job_title_short, 
        job_location, 
        job_posted_date :: DATE AS posted_date, 
        salary_year_avg, 
        company_dim.name AS company_name
FROM job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim
ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills_dim.skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim
    ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim
    ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id;
```
![data description](visuals/query_2.png)
- SQL and Python are leading as the most in-demand skills, both required in 8 out of 10 roles.
- Tableau is also highly sought after, with a bold count of 9. Other skills like R, Excel and Power BI show varying degrees of demand.

### 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts
To identify the skills most frequently listed in job postings for the Data Analyst role, I wrote the query below to focus on areas with high demand.
```sql
SELECT  skills,
        COUNT(skills_dim.skill_id) AS Skill_Count 
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim
ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim
ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY Skill_Count DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
![data description](visuals/query_3.png)
- **SQL is the Most In-Demand Skill:** SQL is mentioned in over 92,628 job postings, making it the most essential skill for Data Analysts. This reflects its critical role in data extraction, manipulation, and querying from databases.

### 4. Skills Based on Salary
I also explored the average salaries associated with different skills, revealing which skills are the highest paying.
```sql
SELECT skills,
        ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS Avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim
ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim
ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY Avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### 5. Most Optimal Skills to Learn
Combining insights from demand and salary data, this query aimed to pinpoint skills that are both in decent demand (Skill_Count â‰¥ 20) and have high average salaries, offering a strategic focus for skill development. 
```sql
SELECT skills,
        ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS Avg_salary,
        COUNT(skills_dim.skill_id) AS Skill_Count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY skills
HAVING COUNT(skills_dim.skill_id) >= 20
ORDER BY Avg_salary DESC,
        Skill_Count DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
